# 🏢 Employee Management Portal

A full-featured, browser-based Employee Management Portal built with **React 19**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **IndexedDB** — requiring zero backend setup. The app provides separate role-based experiences for **HR Managers** and **Employees**.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** v9 or higher

### Installation & Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShahzebFaisal5649/Employee-Management-Portal.git
cd Employee-Management-Portal

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## 🔑 Default Login Credentials

On first run, the app auto-seeds a default HR account into IndexedDB:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| **HR Manager** | `HR@rtc.com` | `hrrtc123` |
| **Employee** | *(Created by HR)* | *(Set by HR)* |

> **To create an Employee account**, log in as HR → go to **Manage Staff** → click **Add Employee**.

---

## 📦 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server with HMR
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build locally
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
```

---

## 🗄️ Data Persistence

All data is stored in the browser's **IndexedDB** under the database name `EmployeePortalDB`. The schema includes three object stores:

- **`users`** — Employee and HR accounts with leave quota
- **`attendance`** — Clock-in/clock-out records per user per day
- **`leaves`** — Leave requests with status (`Pending` / `Approved` / `Rejected`)

> ⚠️ Data is local to the browser. Clearing browser data / site data will reset the app.

---

## 🧩 Key Implementation Highlights

- **Zero-backend architecture** — Fully functional offline-first app using only browser APIs
- **Role-based access** — `ProtectedRoute` wraps every page with role verification
- **Live attendance timer** — Real-time clock-in duration displayed on the Employee Dashboard
- **Leave quota deduction** — Automatically deducted from the employee's balance when HR approves a request
- **Retroactive leave prevention** — The `applyForLeave` function rejects any start date in the past
- **Clean HR attendance view** — Duplicate open-shift entries are handled gracefully for HR reports
